WHAT IS BLIPREAD
----------------

Blipread is a simple way to see how long it takes for you to read a page.
How much time do you have? Read now or later? Here's the answer.

This extension should work on Windows, Mac and Linux. (untested)


USAGE
-----

Just keep the icon visible and see how long does it take for you to read.
Click on the icon to update the time.

Check the options to customize with your reading speed.

Thanks to Tom Ross (@umpox) for the concept.
